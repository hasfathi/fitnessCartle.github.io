		<h1> Cardio</h1><br><br>
        
        <p> Cardio is defined as any type of exercise that gets your heart <br>
	rate up and keeps it up for a prolonged period of time. Your respiratory system<br>
 	will start working harder as you begin to breathe faster and more deeply<br><br>

           Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic <br>
	activity that raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone.<br> 
	This is the zone where you burn the most fat and calories. Some of the most <br>
	common examples of cardio include walking, cycling, and swimming.

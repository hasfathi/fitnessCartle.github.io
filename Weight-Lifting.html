        <p>The sport of lifting barbells competitively or as exercise.For many prehistoric tribes, <br>the traditional test of manhood was to lift a special rock. Such men's stones, some bearing<br> the name of the first lifter, exist in castles in Greece and Scotland. Competitive <br>stone-lifting still exists
        in Germany, Switzerland, the Montenegrin highlands, and the Basque<br> region of Spain. In most such events the number of consecutive lifts in a given time period<br> is used to declare a winner.
